# yt-content-block
A chrome extenstion to block youtube videos based on keywords. No more reaction content!

I made this extension because I was tired of seeing reaction content on youtube. I wanted to block videos that I don't want to see. Youtube only allows blocking of entire channels, not individual videos.

This extension allows you to block videos based on keywords. You can add keywords to the extension's settings page, and the extension will block any videos that contain those keywords.

Blocked videos will first be hidden by an onverlay that still gives you a preview of the video. You can then decide to remove this video permanently. Removed videos will be hidden by a placeholder tile to not break youtube's layout. Permanently removing the video tiles from the DOM broke youtube's ability to load additional content when scrolling the home page.
